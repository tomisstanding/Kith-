# My Kith-test app
![GitHub Logo](/images/kith-test.png)

just hit the fork, or download button and run locally by opening terminal then running the command bundle install, then once everything is installed successfully run a loval server by typing the command rails s in your terminal. You
can now open localhost:3000/products in your web browser of choice and see all the stores products and delete, and add to them. 

Cheers,

Thomas
